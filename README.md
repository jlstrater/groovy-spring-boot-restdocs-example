-----

You can build and run this sample using Gradle:

```
$ gradle build bootRun
```

Or the Gradle Wrapper:

```
$ ./gradlew build bootRun
```

Then access the app via a browser (or curl) on http://localhost:8080/html5/index.html to see the docs.

** It is very important to note that the project must be built before trying to run the project. Otherwise, the docs will not show up! **

## Requirements

Java Version 8-10

MongoDB (use default ports locally or run via Docker)
